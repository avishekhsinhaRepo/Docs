1. Have two file servers with path to sync (eg. F:/shared) and add test files
2. Deploy storage account and create a file share 
3. Deploy Azure File Sync(Storage Sync SVC) on same region as the storage account
4. Within Azure Storage Sync, Create sync group and specify the storage + File Share
5. File shre will be added as cloud endpoint and you need to add server endpoint next
6. Register file servers by downloading and installing the agent 
7. Once installed, login to the agent and select the storage sync svc
8. From Storage Sync Service add server endpoints to the sync group and mention the path that needs to sync
9. validate the setup by going the servers and file share and see if the files are synced
